   - 🌟 What is MCMC?

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is a class of methods used in statistical computing to sample from probability distributions. These methods are particularly valuable for estimating distributions that are difficult to compute directly, especially in high-dimensional spaces. MCMC algorithms create a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, allowing us to generate samples from this distribution by simulating the chain over time.

**Key Concepts:**

Markov Chain: A sequence of random variables where the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the current state (the Markov property). The chain transitions between states in a way that eventually converges to the target distribution.

Monte Carlo: Refers to the use of random sampling to estimate numerical results. In the context of MCMC, it involves using samples generated by the Markov chain to estimate properties of the target distribution.

   - 🔗 Why MCMC is vital in Bayesian inference.

     Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are extensively used in Bayesian statistics to perform posterior inference. Bayesian statistics involves updating our beliefs about parameters using data, resulting in posterior distributions. In many cases, these posterior distributions are complex and do not have closed-form solutions, making direct sampling or analytical integration intractable. MCMC provides a way to generate samples from these complex posterior distributions, allowing us to estimate various properties of the parameters.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how MCMC is used in Bayesian statistics:

### Key Steps in Bayesian Inference Using MCMC

1. **Specify the Bayesian Model**:
   - Define the prior distribution \( \pi(\theta) \) for the parameters \( \theta \).
   - Define the likelihood function \( L(\theta | \mathbf{y}) \) based on the observed data \( \mathbf{y} \).

2. **Posterior Distribution**:
   - The posterior distribution is given by Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     \pi(\theta | \mathbf{y}) = \frac{L(\theta | \mathbf{y}) \pi(\theta)}{p(\mathbf{y})}
     \]
   - Here, \( p(\mathbf{y}) \) is the marginal likelihood or evidence, which is often difficult to compute directly.

3. **Constructing the Markov Chain**:
   - Use an MCMC algorithm to construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution \( \pi(\theta | \mathbf{y}) \).
