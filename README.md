   - 🌟 What is MCMC?

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is a class of methods used in statistical computing to sample from probability distributions. These methods are particularly valuable for estimating distributions that are difficult to compute directly, especially in high-dimensional spaces. MCMC algorithms create a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, allowing us to generate samples from this distribution by simulating the chain over time.

**Key Concepts:**

Markov Chain: A sequence of random variables where the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the current state (the Markov property). The chain transitions between states in a way that eventually converges to the target distribution.

Monte Carlo: Refers to the use of random sampling to estimate numerical results. In the context of MCMC, it involves using samples generated by the Markov chain to estimate properties of the target distribution.
